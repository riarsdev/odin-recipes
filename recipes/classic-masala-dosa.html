    <h1>Classic Masala Dosa</h1>

    <p>A properly made crisp and savory Indian dosa is wonderfully delicious, and fairly simple to make at home, with this caveat: the batter must be fermented overnight for the correct texture and requisite sour flavor. However, once the batter is ready, it can be refrigerated and kept for several days, even a week. With a traditional spicy potato filling, dosas makes a perfect vegetarian breakfast or lunch. Serve them with your favorite chutney.</p>

    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 8 to 10 servings</p>
    
    <h3>FOR THE DOSA BATTER</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups short-grain rice</li>
        <li>½ cup urad dal (split husked black lentils)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>FOR THE POTATO FILLING</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard seeds</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>2 small dried hot red peppers</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>Pinch of asafetida</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated ginger</li>
        <li>6 to 8curry leaves</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 small green chiles, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1½ pounds yellow-fleshed potatoes, such as Yukon Gold, boiled, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>½ cup roughly chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>PREPARATION STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dosa batter: Put rice in a bowl, rinse well and cover with 4 cups cold water. Put urad dal and fenugreek seeds in a small bowl, rinse well and add cold water to cover. Leave both to soak for 4 to 6 hours.</li><br>
        <li>Drain rice and dal-fenugreek mixture in separate colanders. Put rice in a food processor, blender or wet-dry grinder. Add 1 cup cold water and grind to a smooth paste. It will take about 10 minutes, and it may be necessary to work in batches. Repeat the process with the dal-fenugreek mixture.</li><br>
        <li>Combine the two pastes in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk together, adding enough water to obtain a medium-thick batter. You should have about 6 cups. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place. Let ferment until the surface is bubbly, about 8 hours. Stir in the salt. Use the batter straight away or refrigerate for later use. (Batter will keep for up to a week, refrigerated. Thin with water if necessary before proceeding.)</li><br>
        <li>Make the potato filling: Put ghee in a wide skillet over medium heat. When oil is wavy, add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Wait for seeds to pop, about 1 minute, then add red peppers and onion. Cook, stirring until onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Add turmeric, asafetida, ginger, curry leaves, garlic and green chile. Stir to coat and let sizzle for 1 minute.</li><br>
        <li>Add potatoes and ½ cup water. Cook, stirring well to combine, until liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Mash potatoes a bit with the back of a wooden spoon. Season well with salt, add cilantro, then set aside at room temperature. (Potato filling may be prepared up to a day in advance.)</li><br>
        <li>To make dosas, set a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Brush with about 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Ladle ¼ cup batter in the center of griddle. Using bottom of ladle, quickly spread batter outward in a circular motion to a diameter of about 7 inches. Drizzle ½ teaspoon oil over the top. Leave dosa batter to brown gradually until outer edges begin to look dry, about 2 minutes, cooking on one side only. With a spatula, carefully loosen dosa from griddle. Bottom should be crisp and beautifully browned. Spoon ½ cup potato filling onto top of dosa, centering it as a strip in the middle of the round dosa. Flatten the potato mixture slightly. Using the spatula, fold the sides of the dosa around the filling to make a cylindrical shape. Serve immediately. Continue making dosas one at a time.</li><br>
    </ol>

    <h3><em>Tip</em></h3>
    <p><em>If you desire, you can make batter with 3 cups rice flour, 1 cup urad dal flour, ½ teaspoon ground fenugreek and 4½ cups cold water. Ferment for 8 hours, until bubbly, add ½ teaspoon salt and proceed with recipe.</em></p>
