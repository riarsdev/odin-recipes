    <h1>Sago Pudding</h1>
    <img src="../images/sago-pudding.jpg" alt="Image of Sago Pudding" height="300" width="450">

    <p>In Southeast Asia, sago or tapioca pearls are combined with coconut milk or cream to make a jiggly lightly-sweet pudding eaten for dessert or a snack. While it's widely known as sago pudding, it is often made with tapioca since sago is harder to find. (You will often see tapioca packaged and sold as sago). Tapioca is extracted from the cassava root, while sago comes from the spongy insides of tropical palm plants, but they can be used interchangeably in this recipe. After cooking, the pearls will be very sticky, but rinsing them well will remove some of the excess starch. Eat the pudding warm as a soup, at room temperature, or chilled; it thickens as it cools. The beauty of sago pudding is that it is endlessly adaptable: Top with seasonal fresh fruit, compote, canned lychees or swirl through with mango purée. As is common with Chinese desserts, this pudding is not-too-sweet, so top with your favorite sweetener until it's just the way you like it.</p>

    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 6 servings</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sago or small pearl tapioca (not quick-cooking)</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup maple syrup or brown sugar (plus more to serve)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Fresh fruit, such as mango, melon or berries, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>PREPARATION STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium, and add the tapioca or sago. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring every few minutes. Turn off the heat. Cover and let it sit for another 10 to 15 minutes until the pearls are translucent. Drain in a very fine sieve, and rinse them under cold water.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour the coconut cream into a medium saucepan, along with the maple syrup or brown sugar, vanilla extract and ½ cup of water. Stir over medium-low heat for 2 minutes until well combined and smooth, then remove from the heat. Add the pearls to the coconut mixture and stir well.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer the sago pudding to a bowl or separate into smaller bowls or glasses. Allow to cool completely, then chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours. It will thicken into a pudding as it cools.</li><br>
        <li>Serve alone or with fresh fruit with a drizzle of maple syrup or a scattering of brown sugar (or another sweetener).</li><br>
    </ol>

    <h3><em>Tip</em></h3>
    <p><em>Ideally the tapioca or sago pearls should be used immediately after cooking, but if necessary, they can be drained, then transferred to a large bowl of cold water (which will make them less sticky) and held at room temperature for up to an hour. Make sure you add the pearls to boiling water. They will clump together if added to cold water.</em></p>
